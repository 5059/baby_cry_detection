Recognition of baby cry audio signal

This project's aim is to automatically recognize a baby crying while sleeping and start a lullaby to calm him or her down.
This is done by implementing a machine learning algorithm on a Raspberry Pi.
The algorithm is spreviously trained on a computure due to reduced resources available on Raspberry Pi.
